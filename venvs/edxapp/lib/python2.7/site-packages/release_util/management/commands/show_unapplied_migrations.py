    Checks for unapplied migrations.
    Prints out a YAML string of any unapplied migrations, along with their accompanying application name *and*
    the initial migration state of every application with unapplied migrations.
    For example:

    migrations:
      - [app1, 0001_initial]
      - [app2, 0012_otherthing]
      - [app1, 0002_somthing]
    initial_states: {app1: zero, app2: 0011_thisthing}

    If all migrations are applied, returns an empty YAML "migrations" dict.
    This command can be used in a couple of ways:
    1) To generate a list of unapplied migrations
    2) To detect if any unapplied migrations exist and failing if so (by specifying '--fail_on_unapplied')

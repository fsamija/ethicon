These are the fixtures that will be used for tests.\n\n* If you are writing a Check, add the test cases for your check to ``specCases`` in ``test/spec/checks_spec.js``.\n\n* If you are writing a Rule, add the test cases for your rule to ``specCases`` in ``test/spec/rule_spec.js``.\n\n* If needed, any new integration tests can go in ``test/spec/integration_spec.js``.\n","readmeFilename":"README.rst","_id":"edx-custom-a11y-rules@0.1.2","_shasum":"408f4017ffb86d0ad6d9c36b6fa1d244165b420a","_resolved":"git+https://github.com/edx/edx-custom-a11y-rules#fd6a945fe9ade1cc5e560038db69147db66eb3da","_from":"edx-custom-a11y-rules@0.1.2"}
